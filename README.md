PGXN
===

[PGXN](http://www.pgxn.org/), the PostgreSQL Extention network, is a central
distribution system for open-source PostgreSQL extension libraries. In its
first iteration it will consist of four basic parts:

* distribution upload server for extension developers.
* centralized, distributable index of distribution metadata.
* website for searching extensions and perusing their documentation.
* command-line client for downloading, testing, and installing extensions.

Project Status
--------------

The network is up and running! Use [PGXN Manager](http://manager.pgxn.org)
to upload distributions to the network. The search site is currently
in development.

Who’s Doing This? -----------------

[I am](http://justatheory.com/ "Just a Theory"). I’m David Wheeler, inveterate
Perl and PostgreSQL hacker. I love the
[extensibility](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/extend.html) of
PostgreSQL and have long been a fan of [CPAN](http://www.cpan.org/), the Perl
community’s distributed collection of Perl software and documentation. But
PostgreSQL’s extensibility is not well-known, and it’s difficult to find the
extensions that do exist. I’d like to solve that problem. Care to help?
